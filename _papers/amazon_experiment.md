title: "Vertical Integration and Consumer Choice: Evidence from a Field Experiment"
abstract: | 
 Platforms, retailers, and other firms often offer their own products alongside products sold
 by competitors. We study the effects of this practice by combining a field experiment that
 hides brands owned by Amazon (i.e., private labels) from shoppers on Amazon.com with
 model-based counterfactuals and welfare analysis. In the absence of private labels, consumers
 substitute toward products that are similar along most observable dimensions. Removing
 Amazon brands does not change consumers' search effort or their propensity to shop
 at other retail websites. Despite the ample availability of observably similar alternatives, our
 welfare estimates imply that, for the categories we study, removing Amazon brands would
 reduce consumer surplus by 5.4 percent in the short run, with approximately 10 percent
 of the impact due to equilibrium price increases by other sellers. The effects are heterogeneous,
 with consumer surplus reductions exceeding 10 percent in some categories, while
 other categories realize much smaller decreases when Amazon brands are removed. Demoting
 private labels in search results to counteract potential self-preferencing does not lead
 to gains in consumer surplus. This outcome arises because a subset of consumers derive
 greater utility from private labels and benefit from their high placement in search results.
