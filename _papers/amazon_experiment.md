title: "Vertical Integration and Consumer Choice:
        Evidence from a Field Experiment"
abstract:  Many firms, from retailers to investment management companies, offer their own products alongside products sold by competitors. This form of vertical integration has been the target of regulation in digital markets based on concerns of harm to consumers. We study the effects of this practice on consumer choice in the context of Amazon.com. We run a field experiment using a custom browser extension that allows us to generate random variation in the set of products observable to consumers. When Amazon brands are not available, consumers substitute toward products that are comparable along most observable dimensions, including price, average rating, and shipping speed. One exception is that the substitute products have many fewer reviews---often considered a proxy for quality---compared to Amazon brands. We collect supplemental evidence from surveys which shows that consumers view Amazon branded products similarly to other products. On the supply side, we do not find evidence that Amazon discriminates in favor of its own products in search results. In addition, the absence of Amazon brands does not noticeably change consumer search behavior. The results are consistent with consumer preferences that prioritize low prices, high ratings, and fast delivery over other product characteristics, such as brand or seller reputation.
