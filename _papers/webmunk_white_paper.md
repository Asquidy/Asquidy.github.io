title: "Webmunk 2: A Tool for Studying Online Behavior and Digital Platforms"
abstract: Understanding the behavior of users online is important for researchers, policymakers, and companies. But measuring behavior online and conducting experiments is difficult for independent researchers, who do not have access to the user bases or software of technology companies. We introduce Webmunk 2, an improved open-source tool designed to make conducting online studies much easier. Webmunk 2 is a substantial improvement over the original Webmunk, released in 2024. It is easier to use, cheaper to deploy, and more powerful than the original. The user-facing side of Webmunk 2 is a browser extension that can track consumer browsing behavior, capture screenshots for analysis, and experimentally modify consumers' experiences as they browse the Internet. A key innovation is that Webmunk 2 uses a standard back-end stack consisting of Jitsu for data ingestion, Firebase for user management and configuration, and BigQuery for data storage. This makes it more accessible to researchers and software developers who are familiar with these widely-used tools. Through this extension, researchers can collect a host of consumer data, from URLs to ad impressions, clicks, and user responses to in-browser surveys. The extension can also modify information and change the look of a web page, allowing researchers to implement interventions that vary across study participants. We demonstrate the power of Webmunk 2 by discussing ongoing research applications.
