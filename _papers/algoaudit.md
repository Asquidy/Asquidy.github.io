title: "Algorithmic Auditing Using Revealed Preference and Experimental Variation "
abstract: We propose a novel methodology for auditing algorithmic systems by treating them as decision-makers optimizing specific objectives. Combining revealed preference with experimental variation, our approach disentangles the priorities embedded within algorithms. Applying this framework to real-world ranking systems at a leading technology company, we estimate latent utility functions and infer algorithmic trade-offs. Our methodology has implications for fairness, transparency, and accountability in algorithmic decision-making.
