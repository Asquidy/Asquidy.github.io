title: "Search, Matching, and the Role of Digital Marketplace Design in Enabling Trade: Evidence from Airbnb"
category: research
abstract: Digital peer-to-peer marketplaces have increased the volume of trade in underutilized assets. I use the setting of Airbnb to investigate transaction costs in these markets and the role of search engine design in reducing these costs. I show that this market is characterized by many options, heterogeneity in preferences, and uncertain availability. Consequently, search is limited, time-consuming, and sometimes results in failed transaction attempts due to rejections of searchers by hosts. I estimate a model of search and matching and use it to show that the search engine plays a critical role in facilitating transactions. Without availability tracking and filtering, searches with accepted inquiries would fall by 68% and rejections would increase by 140%. Lastly, I show how searcher outcomes can be improved from the status quo (as of 2014) by algorithms that redirect searchers towards listings that are more likely to accept those searchers.

Nontechnical: "People search for jobs, houses, spouses and many other goods. Theory tells us that markets where search is important can work very differently than standard competitive marketplaces. However, it has been difficult to test theories of search in practice because search behavior is typically unobserved. I use a novel dataset of over a million search spells in an online marketplace to study search frictions.

My paper makes three distinct contributions. First, I demonstrate how to use detailed data on communication and transactions in marketplaces in order to quantify the welfare cost of search frictions. Second, I apply my methodology to Airbnb, a large and growing online marketplace for accommodations. Lastly, I study how a market designer can create a set of policies to improve market outcomes.

The word search can refer to any set of actions that individuals undertake in order to acquire more information. Some common types of search include asking friends for advice, browsing the internet, submitting applications and talking to potential partners. In this paper I will focus on just one step in the search process: that of sending contacts and talking to potential partners. 

The welfare cost of search frictions can be broken down into two components. The first is that search itself takes up valuable time and effort. The second is that the lack of perfect information about all options creates suboptimal matches in the marketplace. In turn, the degree to which matches are suboptimal depends on how intensively people search, the information already available to searchers, the amount of congestion in the marketplace and the realized quality of potential partners in the market. The cause of suboptimal matches is critical because it determines what policies should be undertaken to improve market outcomes."
