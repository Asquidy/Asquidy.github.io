title: "Search, Matching, and the Role of Digital Marketplace Design in Enabling Trade: Evidence from Airbnb"
category: research
abstract: Two-sided marketplaces are distinguished by the fact that both sides have preferences regarding each others' non-price characteristics. This paper studies how digital platform design affects transaction costs and volume in these markets by analyzing the decisions of guests and hosts to search and match with each other on Airbnb. I show that the two-sided nature of the market is important. Through 2014, rejections of guests by hosts occur for 42% of inquiries regarding booking and these rejections causally decrease the rate at which guests eventually book on the platform by 43% to 70%. Rejections are primarily caused by stale vacancies and the screening of guests by hosts. I use data on search and communication to estimate a model of guest and host choices. I apply this model to study the effects of search engine design and find that, by tracking listing availability, Airbnb reduces rejections by 59%. I then show that incorporating host preferences into rankings can further increase match rates and discuss how Airbnb's subsequent innovations reflect these findings.

Nontechnical: "People search for jobs, houses, spouses and many other goods. Theory tells us that markets where search is important can work very differently than standard competitive marketplaces. However, it has been difficult to test theories of search in practice because search behavior is typically unobserved. I use a novel dataset of over a million search spells in an online marketplace to study search frictions.

My paper makes three distinct contributions. First, I demonstrate how to use detailed data on communication and transactions in marketplaces in order to quantify the welfare cost of search frictions. Second, I apply my methodology to Airbnb, a large and growing online marketplace for accommodations. Lastly, I study how a market designer can create a set of policies to improve market outcomes.

The word search can refer to any set of actions that individuals undertake in order to acquire more information. Some common types of search include asking friends for advice, browsing the internet, submitting applications and talking to potential partners. In this paper I will focus on just one step in the search process: that of sending contacts and talking to potential partners. 

The welfare cost of search frictions can be broken down into two components. The first is that search itself takes up valuable time and effort. The second is that the lack of perfect information about all options creates suboptimal matches in the marketplace. In turn, the degree to which matches are suboptimal depends on how intensively people search, the information already available to searchers, the amount of congestion in the marketplace and the realized quality of potential partners in the market. The cause of suboptimal matches is critical because it determines what policies should be undertaken to improve market outcomes."
