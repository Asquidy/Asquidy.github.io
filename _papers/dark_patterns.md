title: "Data Sharing and Website Competition: The Role of Dark Patterns"
abstract: Data is a critical part of the digital production function. Regulations such as GDPR require firms to obtain consumer consent prior to using data. In response, firms have adopted a variety of strategies to obtain consent. The strategies often use interface designs or choice architectures that nudge users into sharing more data. We study the causal effects of these designs, and particularly how they vary across individuals and firms. To do so, we implement a field experiment in which users download a browser extension that randomizes across interface designs as users browse the internet. We find that hiding consent options behind an additional click is effective at increasing consent, but that other variations relying on the ordering of consent options have very small effects. We also detect substantial heterogeneity across individuals in their propensities to consent, but limited consent variation across websites. In particular, larger and more prominent firms have only moderately higher consent rates than other firms.
