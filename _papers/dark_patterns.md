title: "Data Sharing and Website Competition: The Role of Dark Patterns"
abstract: >-
  Regulations like the GDPR require firms to obtain consumer consent before using data. In response, some firms employ "dark patterns" &mdash; interface designs that nudge consumers to share data.  We study the causal effects of these designs on consumer consent choices and explore how these effects vary across individuals, firms, and the frequency of these choices. We ran a field experiment where participants installed a browser extension that randomized cookie consent interfaces as they browsed the internet. We find that consumers accept all cookies over half of the time absent dark patterns, with substantial preference heterogeneity across users. In addition, users frequently close the window without making an active choice. When the interface hides certain options behind an extra click, users are significantly more likely to select the options that remain visible. Purely visual manipulations have much smaller effects. Larger and better-known firms achieve higher consent rates, giving them a competitive advantage, but dark patterns do not exacerbate this advantage. We use a structural model of consumer choice to show that the consumer surplus maximizing consent banner uses a neutral design and defaults to accepting cookies when users click out of the banner. We also show that giving users a browser level choice improves consumer welfare relative to asking for consent on a site by site basis.
