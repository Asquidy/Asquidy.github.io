title: "Reciprocity in Two-sided Reputation Systems: Evidence from an Experiment on Airbnb"
category: research
abstract: Reciprocity in feedback may distort information and lead to inefficient outcomes in digital marketplaces. We analyze a large-scale field experiment on Airbnb in which the treatment was a simultaneous reveal review system that eliminated the ability of second reviewers to condition feedback on the content of the first review. The treatment had small negative effects on ratings and content, which points to a limited role of strategic reciprocity in shaping review content prior to the introduction of simultaneous reveal. The treatment also induced 9.7&#37; more host reviews and 1.8&#37; more guest reviews, consistent with a desire to reveal information about a counterpartyâ€™s review by submitting a review. We fail to reject the null of no treatment effect on subsequent transactions by guests and hosts. Even in the absence of strategic reciprocity, there is evidence that some feedback may be distorted. For instance, when a guest does not recommend a host in a private and anonymous response, 19% of public reviews contain a high rating. Using plausibly exogenous variation in observational data, we show that this mismatch is partially explained by market participants interacting in a social manner and consequently omitting negative information in reviews.
