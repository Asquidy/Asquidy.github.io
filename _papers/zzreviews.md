title: "Reciprocity in Two-sided Reputation Systems: Evidence from an Experiment on Airbnb"
category: research
abstract: Reputation systems are used by nearly every digital marketplace but designs vary. One design choice is when to reveal post-transaction feedback to users, which may affect the content of reviews and the speed with which information is distributed in the marketplace. We study the effects of changing feedback revelation timing in a large-scale field experiment on Airbnb. Feedback in the treatment group was hidden until both parties submitted a review and was revealed immediately after submission in the control group. We show that the treatment reduced retaliation and reciprocation in feedback giving. The treatment also stimulated more reviewing in total, due to usersâ€™ curiosity about what the counterparty wrote and/or the desire to have feedback visible to other users. The effects on feedback giving did not translate into a reduction of adverse selection as measured by subsequent transactions and prices.
