title: "Search Frictions and the Design of Online Marketplaces"
category: research
abstract: Search and matching markets are increasingly intermediated by online marketplaces. These marketplaces record novel data about search activity and influence search through policies, such as ranking algorithms, which can make matching outcomes more efficient. I use data from Airbnb, a prominent online marketplace for housing rentals, to show that potential guests engage in limited search, are frequently rejected by hosts, and inefficiently match as a result. I estimate a micro-founded model of search and matching and use it to show that if frictions were removed, there would be 84% more matches in the marketplace and host revenue would increase by $109 per searcher. I propose several improved ranking algorithms for the marketplace and show that they would increase the matching rate by up to 10% over the status quo. However, the A/B search experiments favored by internet companies can overstate the true treatment effect of a ranking algorithm by over 100% because of equilibrium effects.

Nontechnical: "People search for jobs, houses, spouses and many other goods. Theory tells us that markets where search is important can work very differently than standard competitive marketplaces. However, it has been difficult to test theories of search in practice because search behavior is typically unobserved. I use a novel dataset of over a million search spells in an online marketplace to study search frictions.

My paper makes three distinct contributions. First, I demonstrate how to use detailed data on communication and transactions in marketplaces in order to quantify the welfare cost of search frictions. Second, I apply my methodology to Airbnb, a large and growing online marketplace for accommodations. Lastly, I study how a market designer can create a set of policies to improve market outcomes.

The word search can refer to any set of actions that individuals undertake in order to acquire more information. Some common types of search include asking friends for advice, browsing the internet, submitting applications and talking to potential partners. In this paper I will focus on just one step in the search process: that of sending contacts and talking to potential partners. 

The welfare cost of search frictions can be broken down into two components. The first is that search itself takes up valuable time and effort. The second is that the lack of perfect information about all options creates suboptimal matches in the marketplace. In turn, the degree to which matches are suboptimal depends on how intensively people search, the information already available to searchers, the amount of congestion in the marketplace and the realized quality of potential partners in the market. The cause of suboptimal matches is critical because it determines what policies should be undertaken to improve market outcomes."
