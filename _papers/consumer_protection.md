title: "Consumer Protection in an Online World: When Does Occupational Licensing Matter?"
abstract: This paper studies the effects of occupational licensing on outcomes in a large on-line platform for home services, where professional service providers bid on consumers projects. We exploit exogenous variation in the time at which licenses are displayed on the platform to identify the causal effects of licensing information and reviews on consumer choices. We find that platform verified licensing status is not valued by consumers but digital reputation is. Next, we use zip-code by job category variation in licensing stringency to measure the effects of licensing on aggregate market outcomes. Our results show that more stringent licensing leads to less competition and higher prices, but does not improve customer satisfaction.
