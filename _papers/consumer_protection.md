title: "Consumer Protection in an Online World: An Analysis of Occupational Licensing"
abstract: We study the demand and supply implications of occupational licensing using transaction-level data from a large online platform for home improvement services. We find that demand is more responsive to a professional's reviews than to the professional's platform-verified licensing status. We confirm the generality of these results off the platform in an independent consumer survey. We then show that more stringent licensing regulations are associated with less competition, higher prices, and no improvement in consumer satisfaction or demand expansion. These restrictions particularly serve as a barrier to small and new businesses.
