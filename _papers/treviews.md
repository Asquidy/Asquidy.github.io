title: "Bias and Reciprocity in Online Reviews: Evidence From Field Experiments on Airbnb"
category: research
abstract: Online reviews and reputation ratings help consumers choose what goods to buy and whom to trade with. However, potential reviewers are not compensated for submitting reviews or making reviews accurate. This lack of incentives can result in review bias, which occurs when some types of experiences are less likely to result in a review or when reviewers misrepresent their experiences in submitted reviews. We study the determinants and size of bias in online reviews by using proprietary data regarding two field experiments on Airbnb. In the first experiment, we induce more consumers to leave reviews by offering them a coupon. Those induced to review report more negative experiences than reviewers in the control group. In our second experiment, we remove the possibility of retaliation and reciprocation in reviews by changing the rules of the review system. We show that fear of retaliation, retaliation against negative reviews, and reciprocity of positive reviews all cause bias but that the magnitude of this bias is smaller than the bias due to sorting. Lastly, we document a new reason for bias in evaluations, socially induced reciprocity, which occurs when buyers and sellers interact socially and consequently omit negative information from reviews. This mechanism represents a major challenge for online marketplaces that intermediate transactions involving social interaction.
