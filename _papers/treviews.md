title: "Bias and Reciprocity in Online Reviews: Evidence From Field Experiments on Airbnb"
category: research
abstract: Reviews and other evaluations are used by consumers to decide what goods to buy and by firms to choose whom to trade with, hire, or promote. However, because potential reviewers are not compensated for submitting reviews and may have reasons to omit relevant information in their reviews, reviews may be biased. We use the setting of Airbnb to study the determinants of reviewing behavior, the extent to which reviews are biased, and whether changes in the design of reputation systems can reduce that bias. We find that while reviews on Airbnb are generally informative and 97% of guests privately report having positive experiences, bias still exists. Using two field experiments, we show that non-reviewers have worse experiences than reviewers and that strategic reviewing behavior occurs on the site, although the aggregate effect of the strategic behavior is relatively small. Furthermore, we find that some reviewers who privately report negative experiences, nonetheless submit positive public reviews. We attribute much of this behavior to socially induced reciprocity, which occurs when buyers and sellers form a social relationship and consequently omit negative information from reviews. Lastly, we use a quantitative exercise to show that when negative experiences do occur, they are not captured in review text 63% of the time.
