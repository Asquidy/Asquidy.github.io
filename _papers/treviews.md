title: "Bias and Reciprocity in Online Reviews: Evidence From Field Experiments on Airbnb"
category: research
abstract: Online reviews and reputation ratings help consumers choose what goods to buy and whom to trade with. However, potential reviewers are not compensated for submitting reviews or making reviews accurate. Therefore, the distribution of submitted evaluations may differ from the distribution of experiences had by market participants. We study the determinants and size of bias in online reviews by using field experiments on Airbnb. We show that reviews exhibit some bias. In the first experiment, we induce more consumers to leave reviews by offering them a coupon. Those induced to review report more negative experiences than reviewers in the control group. In our second experiment, we remove the possibility of retaliation and reciprocation in reviews by changing the rules of the review system. We show that bias due to strategic reasons is relatively small but that fear of retaliation, retaliation against negative reviews, and reciprocity of positive reviews all cause bias. Lastly, we document a new reason for bias in evaluations, socially induced reciprocity, which occurs when buyers and sellers interact socially and consequently omit negative information from reviews. This mechanism causes at least as much bias as the strategic motivations that we consider and represents a major challenge for online marketplaces that intermediate transactions involving social interaction.
