title: "Bias and Reciprocity in Online Reviews: Evidence From Field Experiments on Airbnb"
category: research
abstract: User-generated online reviews and reputation ratings help consumers choose what goods to buy and whom to trade with. However, potential reviewers are not compensated for submitting reviews or making reviews accurate. Therefore, the distribution of submitted reviews may differ from the true distribution of experiences had by market participants. We study the determinants and size of bias in online reviews by using field experiments on Airbnb. We show that reviews are indeed biased. In the first experiment, we pay consumers to leave reviews if they had not done so already. We find that the rate of positive reviews falls by 5.6% in the treatment group. In our second experiment, we remove the possibility of retaliation in reviews by changing the rules of the review system. We find that bias due to strategic reasons is small but that retaliation against negative reviews and reciprocity of positive reviews both occur. Lastly, we document a new type of bias in online reviews, socially induced reciprocity, which occurs when buyers and sellers interact socially and consequently omit negative information from reviews out of politeness. This form of bias is at least as large as bias due to strategic motivations, and therefore represents a major challenge for online marketplaces that intermediate real world transactions.
