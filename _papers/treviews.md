title: "Reporting Bias and Reciprocity in Online Reviews: Evidence From Field Experiments on Airbnb"
category: research
abstract: Reviews and reputation scores are increasingly important for decision-making, especially in the case of online marketplaces. However, online reviews may not provide an accurate depiction of the characteristics of a product, either because many people do not leave reviews or because some reviewers omit salient information. We study the causes and magnitude of bias in online reviews by using large-scale field experiments that change the incentives of buyers and sellers to honestly review each other. We find that reviews are biased because individuals with worse experiences are less likely to leave reviews and because individuals omit salient information in public reviews. However, the fear of retaliation is a relatively minor factor in reviewing behavior. Our results are consistent with behavioral models in which face-to-face interaction induces reciprocity amongst individuals.
