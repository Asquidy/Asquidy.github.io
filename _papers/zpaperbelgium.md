title: "The Effect of Parental Income on Early Career Outcomes "
category: research
abstract: Young adults entering the labor force typically have little access to unemployment insurance or other formal insurance mechanisms. Instead, they rely on family insurance in the form of parental support to smooth consumption. We study the labor market response of Belgian young adults to decreases in available parental support caused by parental job-loss. Our estimates correct for unobserved heterogeneity by using the timing of parental shocks before and after labor market entry. We find that a child whose parent loses a job prior to the child's labor market entry is, on average, induced to work 6% more in the 3 years following labor market entry than a child whose parent loses a job after the child's entry. This effect is concentrated on the extensive margin and disappears within four years after entry. We find no evidence that parental support affects the quality of the initial job that entrants find.
