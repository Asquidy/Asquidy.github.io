title: "Blame the Parents? How Financial Incentives Affect Labor Supply and Job Quality for Young Adults"
category: research
abstract: Young adults entering the labor force typically have little access to unemployment insurance or other formal insurance mechanisms. We study the role of parental support as an informal insurance mechanism and its effects on labor market entrants. Specifically, we analyze the labor supply and job quality responses of Belgian young adults to parental job displacements. Our estimates correct for unobserved heterogeneity by using the timing of parental shocks before and after labor market entry. We find that a child whose parent loses a job prior to the child’s labor market entry is, on average, induced to work 9 percent more in the 3 years following labor market entry than a child whose parents lose a job after the child’s entry (where labor market entry is defined as the end of the child’s full-time education). This effect is concentrated on the extensive margin and decreases in magnitude over time. We find no evidence that parental support affects the quality of the initial job that entrants find.
