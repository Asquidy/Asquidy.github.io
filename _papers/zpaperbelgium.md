title: "Blame the Parents? How Parental Unemployment Affects Labor Supply and Job Quality for Young Adults"
category: research
abstract: We study the role of shocks to parental income in determining the labor market outcomes of children entering the labor market. We find that a child whose parent loses a job prior to the child’s labor market entry is, on average, induced to work 9 percent more in the 3 years following labor market entry than a child whose parents lose a job after the child’s entry. This effect is concentrated on the extensive margin and decreases in magnitude over time. We find no evidence that parental support affects the quality of the initial job that entrants find.
