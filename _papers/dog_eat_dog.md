title: "Dog Eat Dog: Measuring Network Effects Using a Digital Platform Merger"
abstract: Large digital platforms are economically important and are increasingly the subject of regulatory scrutiny. In comparison to markets with multiple competitors, a single platform may increase consumer welfare if network effects are large or may decrease welfare due to higher prices or a reduction in product variety. We measure this trade-off in the context of the merger between the two largest platforms for pet-sitting services. We use the following intuition and a difference-in-differences approach to causally estimate network effects. In local markets where the acquiring platform is already dominant, the merger has little effect on the size of the combined platform. On the other hand, in markets where the two competing platforms are of similar sizes, combining the users should lead to sizable improvements in user outcomes because of network effects. We find that users of the acquiring platform benefited from the union due to network effects. However, users of the acquired platform were more likely to leave the market and those who stayed experienced a reduction in match rates. This is likely due to a reduction in product variety and switching costs. Overall, consumers are, on average, not substantially better off with a single combined platform than with two separate and competing platforms.
