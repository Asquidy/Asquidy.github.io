title: "Dog Eat Dog: Measuring Network Effects Using a Digital Platform Merger"
abstract: A monopolistic platform may increase consumer welfare if network effects are large enough to offset pricing power and reduction in platform variety. We use a difference-in-differences approach to study the net effect of this trade-off in the context of a merger between the two largest pet-sitting platforms. We find that platform prices did not change, users of the acquiring platform benefited from the merger because of network effects, and users of the acquired platform were harmed because their platform was shut down. These effects offset each other so that user outcomes are similar, on average, before and after the merger.
