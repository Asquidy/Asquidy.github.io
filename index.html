			<a href="http://andreyfradkin.com/assets/Fradkin_JMP.pdf">Search Frictions and the Design of Online Marketplaces (Job Market Paper)</a>
		</div>
	Search and matching markets are increasingly intermediated by online marketplaces. These marketplaces record novel data about search activity and influence search through policies, such as ranking algorithms, which can make matching outcomes more efficient. I use data from Airbnb, a prominent online marketplace for housing rentals, to show that potential guests engage in limited search, are frequently rejected by hosts, and inefficiently match as a result. I estimate a micro-founded model of search and matching and use it to show that if frictions were removed, there would be 84% more matches in the marketplace and host revenue would increase by $109 per searcher. I propose several improved ranking algorithms for the marketplace and show that they would increase the matching rate by up to 10% over the status quo. However, the A/B search experiments favored by internet companies can overstate the true treatment effect of a ranking algorithm by over 100% because of equilibrium effects.

			The Impact of Unemployment Insurance on Job Search: Evidence from Google Search Data</a><br>(with <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~srbaker/">Scott Baker</a>)
		</div>
	We develop and validate a measure of job search based on Google search data and use it to study the effects of unemployment insurance (UI). We show that individuals on UI search 30% less than the unemployed not on UI and that claimants close to UI exhaustion search twice as much as claimants with over 30 weeks left. We use our estimates to calibrate a model of job finding and find that the decrease in job search due to UI expansions was responsible for an increase in the unemployment rate of less than 0.1% in Texas between 2008 and 2009.

			The Welfare Economics of Default Options in 401(k) Plans</a> (with <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~bernheim/">Douglas Bernheim</a> and Igor Popov) - <em> R&R at the American Economic Review </em> 
		</div>
	
	Default contribution rates for 401(k) pension plans powerfully influence workers&#39; choices. Potential causes include opt-out costs, procrastination, inattention, and psychological anchoring. We examine the welfare implications of defaults under each theory using the framework for behavioral welfare economics developed by Bernheim and Rangel (2009). We show how the optimal default, the magnitude of the welfare effects, and the degree of normative ambiguity depend on the behavioral model, the scope of the choice domain deemed welfare-relevant, the use of penalties for passive choice, and other 401(k) plan features. In some settings, non-participation emerges as the optimal default, contrary to common wisdom.

			The Effect of Family Insurance on Early Career Outcomes (with Frederic Panier and <a href="http://homepages.vub.ac.be/~itojerow/">Ilan Tojerow</a>) <a href="http://andreyfradkin.com/assets/belgium_slides.pdf"> Slides </a>
		</div>
		In most countries, eligibility for unemployment benefits requires a minimal amount of work experience. Therefore, family support constitutes the main form of insurance available to new members of the labor force looking for work. As a consequence, entrants to the labor market with less access to family insurance have an incentive to increase their job search effort and accept lower quality jobs. This can potentially lead to inefficient allocation of workers and lower long-term earnings. Using Belgian administrative data, we provide the first test of these mechanisms by studying entrants whose parents are subject to three major income shocks (death, long term sickness, job displacement) near the time of the child&#39;s entry into the labor force. Our estimates correct for unobserved heterogeneity by using the timing of parental shocks before and after labor market entry.

			What is the Consumer Surplus From a New and Growing Marketplace? Evidence from Airbnb <a href="http://andreyfradkin.com/assets/NetInstitutePres.pdf"> Slides </a>
		</div>
		
		Online marketplaces for labor, housing and dating are becoming more prominent in their respective industries. These marketplaces succeed by reducing transaction costs and enabling better matches to occur. The theoretical literature on two-sided markets has typically postulated that these marketplaces are characterized by increasing returns to scale. However, the size of increasing returns in two-sided marketplaces and the mechanisms that cause them have never been empirically documented. In this paper, I use data from Airbnb, a large online marketplace for housing, to study the quantitative importance of several mechanisms that potentially generate increasing returns to scale.
