		</div>
	Online marketplaces increasingly act as intermediaries in labor, housing, dating, and other markets where traders match with each other. These marketplaces use novel data generated by users' activities on the website to design algorithms and products that influence the search and matching process. I use internal data from Airbnb, a prominent online marketplace for housing rentals, to study the efficiency of this market and the effects of ranking algorithms. I first show that potential guests engage in limited search, are frequently rejected by hosts, and match at lower rates as a result. I then estimate a micro-founded model of search and matching and use it to show that if frictions were removed, there would be 102% more matches in the marketplace. I propose and evaluate several ranking algorithms and show that a personalized algorithm would increase the matching rate by up to 10% over the status quo. However, due to equilibrium effects, the A/B search experiments favored by internet companies can overstate the true treatment effect of an algorithm by over 100% in some cases.

			 Bias and Reciprocity in Online Reviews: Evidence from Field Experiments on Airbnb (Secondary Job Market Paper) <br>

	Online reviews and reputation ratings help consumers choose what goods to buy and whom to trade with. However, potential reviewers are not compensated for submitting reviews or making reviews accurate. Therefore, the distribution of submitted evaluations may differ from the distribution of experiences had by market participants. We study the determinants and size of bias in online reviews by using field experiments on Airbnb. We show that reviews are indeed biased. In the first experiment, we induce more consumers to leave reviews by offering them a coupon. Those induced to review report more negative experiences than reviewers in the control group. In our second experiment, we remove the possibility of retaliation and reciprocation in reviews by changing the rules of the review system. We show that bias due to strategic reasons is relatively small but that fear of retaliation, retaliation against negative reviews, and reciprocity of positive reviews all cause bias. Lastly, we document a new reason for bias in evaluations, socially induced reciprocity, which occurs when buyers and sellers interact socially and consequently omit negative information from reviews. This mechanism causes at least as much bias as the strategic motivations that we consider and represents a major challenge for online marketplaces that intermediate transactions involving social interaction.

			The Welfare Economics of Default Options in 401(k) Plans</a> <br> <em> Revise and Resubmit at the American Economic Review </em> <br>

	Default contribution rates for 401(k) pension plans powerfully influence workers’ choices. Potential causes include opt-out costs, procrastination, inattention, and psychological anchoring. We examine the welfare implications of defaults under each of these theories. We show how the optimal default, the magnitude of the welfare effects, and the degree of normative ambiguity depend on the behavioral model, the scope of the choice domain deemed welfare-relevant, the use of penalties for passive choice, and other 401(k) plan features. Depending on which theory and welfare perspective one adopts, virtually any default contribution rate may be optimal. Still, our analysis provides reasonably robust justifications for setting the default either at the highest contribution rate matched by the employer or – contrary to common wisdom – at zero. We also identify the types of empirical evidence needed to determine which case is applicable.

			The Impact of Unemployment Insurance on Job Search: Evidence from Google Search Data</a> <br>
			<em> Submitted </em>
			<br><div style="font-size:16;"> (with <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/srbaker/'>Scott R. Baker</a>)</div>
		</div>
	We develop and validate a measure of job search based on Google search data and use it to study the effects of unemployment insurance (UI). We show that individuals on UI search 30% less than the unemployed not on UI and that claimants close to UI exhaustion search twice as much as claimants with over 30 weeks left. We use our estimates to calibrate a model of job finding and find that the decrease in job search due to UI expansions was responsible for an increase in the unemployment rate of less than 0.1% in Texas between 2008 and 2009.

		</div>
		Young adults entering the labor force typically have little access to unemployment insurance or other formal insurance mechanisms. Instead, they rely on family insurance in the form of parental support to smooth consumption. We study the labor market response of Belgian young adults to decreases in available parental support caused by parental job-loss. Our estimates correct for unobserved heterogeneity by using the timing of parental shocks before and after labor market entry. We find that a child whose parent loses a job prior to the child's labor market entry is, on average, induced to work 6% more in the 3 years following labor market entry than a child whose parent loses a job after the child's entry. This effect is concentrated on the extensive margin and disappears within four years after entry. We find no evidence that parental support affects the quality of the initial job that entrants find.

			Market Structure with the Entry of Peer-to-Peer Platforms: The Case of Hotels and Airbnb <br>
			<div style="font-size: 16px;"> (with Chiara Forranato) </div>
		</div>
		Online marketplaces have reduced entry costs across a variety of industries. These marketplaces allow small and part-time service providers (peers) to participate in economic exchange. For example, Airbnb allows anyone to become a hotelier and Uber allows anyone to become a cab driver. The entry of peer-to-peer competitors has two effects: market expansion and business stealing. The first effect occurs when the peer-to-peer sector supplies price sensitive or niche consumers who were previously underserved. The second effect occurs when the peer-to-peer sector attracts consumers away from conventional suppliers. We study these two effects using data from the hotel industry and Airbnb. We show that the market expansion and business stealing effects differ by location, and attribute this heterogeneity to supply constraints - legal and geographic - relative to the level of demand. We then derive a simple model of competition between a peer-to-peer marketplace and hotels to explain these findings. In the model, hotels and peer-to-peer suppliers differ in their fixed (higher for hotels) and marginal costs (higher for peer-to-peer suppliers). The model allows us to study how the efficient market structure depends on the level and variability of demand, and to quantify the welfare gains from peer-to-peer entry in the accommodation industry.
