<div>
I use data on searches and transactions in an online marketplace to study market efficiency and policy. The setting of this paper is Airbnb, a prominent online marketplace for short-term housing rentals. Search on Airbnb occurs when potential guests browse the website and send inquiries to hosts about rooms to stay in. Despite the substantial reduction in search costs due to the marketplace, only 48% of searchers who send inquiries eventually match. I build a model with directed search, heterogeneous agents, and multiple search frictions to explain the match rate and other market outcomes. I find that if search frictions were removed, there would be 78% more matches in the marketplace and that host revenue would increase by $62 per searcher. I study a set of policies aimed at reducing the impact of search frictions. Of these policies, personalized ranking algorithms lead to the biggest improvement, increasing the match rate by 7% over the baseline. Finally, I show that the A/B search experiments favored by internet platforms overstate these improvements by more than 90%.

<div style = "font-size: 18px; font-style:italic"> Revise and Resubmit at the American Economic Review </div>
<p></p>

<div>
Default contribution rates for 401(k) pension plans powerfully influence workers' choices. Potential causes include opt-out costs, procrastination, inattention, and psychological anchoring. We examine the welfare implications of defaults under each theory using the framework for behavioral welfare economics developed by Bernheim and Rangel (2009). We show how the optimal default, the magnitude of the welfare effects, and the degree of normative ambiguity depend on the behavioral model, the scope of the choice domain deemed welfare-relevant, the use of penalties for passive choice, and other 401(k) plan features. In some settings, non-participation emerges as the optimal default, contrary to common wisdom.

<li style="list-style: none;"> <a href="http://andreyfradkin.com/assets/FullTexasJobSearch.pdf">The Impact of Unemployment Insurance on Job Search: Evidence from Google Search Data 
</a> (w/ Scott Baker)
<div style = "font-size: 18px; font-style:italic"> Submitted </div>
<div>
<p></p>

We use Google search data to construct the first high-frequency, location-specific index of job search activity (GJSI). We demonstrate the GJSI's validity and study the effect of increased unemployment insurance (UI) on job search activity. Using the universe of administrative Texas UI records from 2006-2011, we show that individuals receiving UI search less than individuals who are unemployed and who are not receiving UI. We also find that individuals with 0 to 10 weeks of UI remaining search over two times more than those with more than 10 weeks remaining. We document that the GJSI temporarily decreases by up to 4.3% in the 4 weeks after expansions in UI policy. Our calculations suggest that, while expansions in unemployment insurance do drive temporary changes in job search, the immediate effects of expansions are unlikely to result in large changes to unemployment rates.
