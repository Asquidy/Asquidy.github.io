<div>
I use data on searches and transactions in an online marketplace to study market efficiency and policy. The setting of this paper is Airbnb, a prominent online marketplace for short-term housing rentals. Search on Airbnb occurs when potential guests browse the website and send inquiries to hosts about rooms to stay in. Despite the substantial reduction in search costs due to the marketplace, only 48% of searchers who send inquiries eventually match. I build a model with directed search, heterogeneous agents, and multiple search frictions to explain the match rate and other market outcomes. I find that if search frictions were removed, there would be 78% more matches in the marketplace and that host revenue would increase by $62 per searcher. I study a set of policies aimed at reducing the impact of search frictions. Of these policies, personalized ranking algorithms lead to the biggest improvement, increasing the match rate by 7% over the baseline. Finally, I show that the A/B search experiments favored by internet platforms overstate these improvements by more than 90%.

<div style = "font-size: 18px; font-style:italic"> Revise and Resubmit at the American Economic Review </div>
<p></p>

<div>
Default contribution rates for 401(k) pension plans powerfully influence workers' choices. Potential causes include opt-out costs, procrastination, inattention, and psychological anchoring. We examine the welfare implications of defaults under each theory using the framework for behavioral welfare economics developed by Bernheim and Rangel (2009). We show how the optimal default, the magnitude of the welfare effects, and the degree of normative ambiguity depend on the behavioral model, the scope of the choice domain deemed welfare-relevant, the use of penalties for passive choice, and other 401(k) plan features. In some settings, non-participation emerges as the optimal default, contrary to common wisdom.

</a> (w/ Scott Baker)
<div style = "font-size: 18px; font-style:italic"> Submitted </div>
<div>
<p></p>

We develop and validate a measure of job search based on Google search data and use it to study the effects of unemployment insurance (UI). We show that individuals on UI search 30% less than the unemployed not on UI and that claimants close to UI exhaustion search twice as much as claimants with over 30 weeks left. We use our estimates to calibrate a model of job finding and find that the decrease in job search due to UI expansions was responsible for an increase in the unemployment rate of less than 0.1% in Texas between 2008 and 2009.
