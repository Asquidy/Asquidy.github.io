<div id="about">     
	I am an economist who studies how participants in labor, housing and similar markets find matches. I use novel data to build quantitative models of the matching process and use those models to inform policy. I am also interested in quantifying how digitization affects market structure and outcomes. I am finishing my Ph.D. in economics at Stanford and I work as a part-time data scientist at Airbnb. Next academic year I will be doing an Economics of Digitization post-doc at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). In my free time I climb, write, watch movies and walk around discussing philosophy.
