<div id="about">     
	I am an economist who studies <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics_of_digitization">digitization </a> and <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_theory_(economics)"> search and matching markets</a>. I've written papers on topics such as the design of Airbnb’s search and matching algorithm, reputation systems, online job search, and 401(k) contribution choices by workers.

	I am currently an assistant professor of marketing at the Boston University Questrom School of Business and an affiliate of the Boston University Economics Department. My academic research has been published in top marketing, economics, and computer science outlets. I've provided expert input about the digital economy at the President’s Council on Science and Technology and the Federal Trade Commission. Prior to BU, I was a postdoc at the Initiative on the Digital Economy at MIT. I worked as a data scientist at Airbnb while completing a Ph.D. in Economics at Stanford University. In my free time, I climb, write, and make a podcast.
