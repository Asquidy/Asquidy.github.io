<div id="about">     
	I am a social scientist who studies the economics of digital markets and AI, quantitative marketing, and search and matching markets</a>.
	<br>
	<br>
	I am currently an associate professor of marketing (with tenure) at the Boston University Questrom School of Business and an affiliate of the Boston University Economics Department. I am on leave from Boston University working on economics of AI at Amazon. My academic research has been published in top marketing, economics, and computer science outlets. I've provided expert input about the digital economy to the Presidentâ€™s Council on Science and Technology and the Federal Trade Commission. Prior to BU, I was a postdoc at the Initiative on the Digital Economy at MIT. I worked as a data scientist at Airbnb while completing a Ph.D. in Economics at Stanford University. In my free time, I climb, write, and make a podcast.
