<div id="about">     
	I am an economist who studies how digitization is changing the economy as well as how search and matching markets work. I am especially interested in using data on user behavior to inform the design of online marketplaces such as Airbnb, Odesk, Ebay and dating sites. I am currently an economics of digitization post-doc at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) as well as a part-time data scientist at Airbnb. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from Stanford University in 2014 and a B.S. in Mathametics and Economics from Duke University in 2008. In my free time I climb, write, watch movies and walk around discussing philosophy.
