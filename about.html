<div id="about">     
	I am an economist who studies the economics of <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics_of_digitization">digitization </a> and the economics of <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_theory_(economics)"> search and matching markets </a>. I've written papers on topics such as the design of Airbnb’s search and matching algorithm, reputation systems, online job search, and 401(k) contribution choices by workers.

	My current position is as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Initiative on the Digital Economy at MIT. My research has been published in both economics journals (The American Economic Review, The Review of Economics and Statistics) and computer science conferences (ACM-EC). I've provided expert input about the digital economy at the President’s Council on Science and Technology and the Federal Trade Commission. Prior to MIT, I worked as a data scientist at Airbnb while completing a Ph.D. in Economics at Stanford University. In my free time, I climb, write, and make a podcast.
