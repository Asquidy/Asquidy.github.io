<div id="about">     
	I am an economist who studies the economics of <a href = "http://www.nber.org/chapters/c12987.pdf">digitization </a> and the economics of <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_theory_(economics)"> search and matching markets </a>. I am especially interested in using data on user behavior to inform the design of online marketplaces. I am currently an economics of digitization post-doc at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) and a part-time data scientist at Airbnb. I received a Ph.D. in Economics from Stanford University in 2014 and a B.S. in Math and Econ from Duke University in 2008. In my free time I climb, write, watch movies, and walk around discussing philosophy.
