TopText.8: 
<<<
- For similar levels of *measured* intelligence, closed-source models are 8 times more expensive, but are dominant.
- Intelligence-adjusted prices have fallen by approximately 100-fold since the launch of GPT-4.
- New models reach peak market share quickly, within a few weeks on OpenRouter and within 3 - 6 months on Azure. 
- Demand for models is differentiated by brand and use case.
- Adoption of frontier reasoning models is very limited.
- The market for open-source model inference is competitive with free entry of providers.

TopTitle: Measuring Model Intelligence 

TopText: 
- Lots of benchmarks: MMLU Pro, GPQA, HLE, LiveCodeBench, etc....
- Model performance across these is very correlated.
- We use an index from Artificial Analysis.
- Open question: how much do these benchmarks actually correlate with utility?

TopText.8: 
<<<
- Models are getting better and cheaper.
- Closed-source models still dominate even though they are more expensive.
- Substitution between models is fast, but patterns of substitution suggest model differentiation.
- Concentration indices and switching behavior suggest a competitive industry.
- Much more work to do!
