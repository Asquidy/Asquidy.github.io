Labor institutions in the United States have been based on long-run exclusive relationships between a worker and a firm. However, for many people the rigidity of full time work for one company is very constraining. Long-term employees are often tied to sub-optimal specific work hours, work days and locations. There are strong forces that are making full time employment less necessary as a form of organizing production. 

First, online marketplaces are reducing the costs of contracting out labor and working independently. Some marketplaces such as Taskrabbit allow for the direct transfer of labor between individuals. Others such as Etsy and Ebay allow individuals to sell their own products without the support of an employer. These marketplaces are complemented by workers' ability to establish credible online reputations through blogs, work portfolios (Github) and social references (LinkedIn).

A second trend supporting the increased viability of a contractor economy is that physical presence is no longer needed for many occupations (although it is still important for creative and on-site work). It is easy to imagine that a doctor or lawyer located in a completely difficult location can consult clients online. The diminished necessity of physical presence is amplified by the fact that there are large geographic differences in cost of living. It might not make sense to pay a personal assistant the market wage in the Bay Area but it might makes sense to pay the market wage in Arizona. 

Lastly, part-time and flexible lifestyles are gaining in popularity and social acceptance. Some people prefer to work less than 40 hours a week. Others prefer working in month long bursts. Contracting allows these individuals to do exactly that. Books like The 4-Hour Workweek make the case that such lifestyles are optimal.

One under-appreciated fact about contract labor is that it is often lower skilled than the typical occupation. The professions that are most likely to be organized based on contracting are those that require the least organization specific knowledge. Further, contractor professions are often the most standardized and easiest to evaluate through simple mechanisms such as reputation systems. Gardeners, couriers and construction workers are easier to evaluate than finance specialists or lawyers.  

Unfortunately, lower skilled contractors are specifically hurt by the structure of the social safety net in the US.  Unemployment insurance and health care in the US is organized with the assumption permanent employment relation. The health care subsidy for employers, for example, provides a huge incentive to work as an employee at a firm rather than starting a new business. In order for contracting to be a viable lifestyle for more individuals, there must be a way for these individuals to insure against income loss and health shocks. The US needs to divise a system in which health care and unemployment insurance is not tied to a specific job. How that is to be done, remains to be seen.
