[Search Frictions and the Design of Online Marketplaces](/assets/Fradkin_JMP.pdf) \( Job Market Paper \)

[Abstract] (#Abstract) / Non-Technical Overview / Slides / Code / Data

{:#Abstract}
I use data on searches and transactions in an online marketplace to study market efficiency and policy. The setting of this paper is Airbnb, a prominent online marketplace for short-term housing rentals. Search on Airbnb occurs when potential guests browse the website and send inquiries to hosts about rooms to stay in. Despite the substantial reduction in search costs due to the marketplace, only 48% of searchers who send inquiries eventually match. I build a model with directed search, heterogeneous agents, and multiple search frictions to explain the match rate and other market outcomes. I find that if search frictions were removed, there would be 78% more matches in the marketplace and that host revenue would increase by $62 per searcher. I study a set of policies aimed at reducing the impact of search frictions. Of these policies, personalized ranking algorithms lead to the biggest improvement, increasing the match rate by 7% over the baseline. Finally, I show that the A/B search experiments favored by internet platforms overstate these improvements by more than 90%. 

<!--- {:#NTO} Non-Technical Overview:

People search for jobs, houses, spouses and many other goods. Theory tells us that markets where search is important can work very differently than standard competitive marketplaces. However, it has been difficult to test theories of search in practice because search behavior is typically unobserved. I use a novel dataset of over a million search spells in an online marketplace to study search frictions.

My paper makes three distinct contributions. First, I demonstrate how to use detailed data on communication and transactions in marketplaces in order to quantify the welfare cost of search frictions. Second, I apply my methodology to Airbnb, a large and growing online marketplace for accommodations. Lastly, I study how a market designer can create a set of policies to improve market outcomes.

The word search can refer to any set of actions that individuals undertake in order to acquire more information. Some common types of search include asking friends for advice, browsing the internet, submitting applications and talking to potential partners. In this paper I will focus on just one step in the search process: that of sending contacts and talking to potential partners. 

The welfare cost of search frictions can be broken down into two components. The first is that search itself takes up valuable time and effort. The second is that the lack of perfect information about all options creates suboptimal matches in the marketplace. In turn, the degree to which matches are suboptimal depends on how intensively people search, the information already available to searchers, the amount of congestion in the marketplace and the realized quality of potential partners in the market. The cause of suboptimal matches is critical because it determines what policies should be undertaken to improve market outcomes.
