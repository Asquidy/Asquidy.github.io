{:#Abstract}
Search occurs in many markets but its importance for economic outcomes has been difficult to quantify because of a lack of data. I use data on browsing, communications, and transactions from Airbnb, a large and growing online marketplace for accommodations, to show that search frictions are important and that appropriate policies can reduce search frictions. Search on Airbnb occurs when potential guests browse the website and send inquiries to hosts about rooms to stay in. Only 15% of inquiries and 48% of searchers who send inquiries for a potential trip transact on Airbnb. I explain matching outcomes with an equilibrium model that includes directed search, limited consideration sets and incomplete information about which hosts are willing to transact. Search frictions in the model combine to reduce transaction probabilities by 21% and host revenue by $62 per searcher compared to outcomes achievable by a fully informed social planner who maximizes consumer surplus. Policies that improve the set of options searchers consider increase matching rates and consumer surplus. The benefit of search policies depends on the tightness of the market and the share of utility that the marketplace can explain using observable data.

<!--- {:#NTO} Non-Technical Overview:

People search for jobs, houses, spouses and many other goods. Theory tells us that markets where search is important can work very differently than standard competitive marketplaces. However, it has been difficult to test theories of search in practice because search behavior is typically unobserved. I use a novel dataset of over a million search spells in an online marketplace to study search frictions.

My paper makes three distinct contributions. First, I demonstrate how to use detailed data on communication and transactions in marketplaces in order to quantify the welfare cost of search frictions. Second, I apply my methodology to Airbnb, a large and growing online marketplace for accommodations. Lastly, I study how a market designer can create a set of policies to improve market outcomes.

The word search can refer to any set of actions that individuals undertake in order to acquire more information. Some common types of search include asking friends for advice, browsing the internet, submitting applications and talking to potential partners. In this paper I will focus on just one step in the search process: that of sending contacts and talking to potential partners. 

The welfare cost of search frictions can be broken down into two components. The first is that search itself takes up valuable time and effort. The second is that the lack of perfect information about all options creates suboptimal matches in the marketplace. In turn, the degree to which matches are suboptimal depends on how intensively people search, the information already available to searchers, the amount of congestion in the marketplace and the realized quality of potential partners in the market. The cause of suboptimal matches is critical because it determines what policies should be undertaken to improve market outcomes.
