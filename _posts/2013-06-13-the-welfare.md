{:#abstract} Abstract:

According to previous research, changing the default contribution rate for a 401(k) pension plan has a powerful effect on the distribution of contributions among relatively new employees. Potential explanations include the effort and inconvenience of opt-out, procrastination, inattention and psychological anchoring. We show that in order to rationalize contribution behavior in a standard model, average opt out costs must (unreasonably) be over 5% of annual income and that the welfare benefits of offering an optimal default compared to a 0 default is over 30% of the benefit of having a 401(k) plan. We then apply the Bernheim and Rangel (2009) framework to show that the normative implications of defaults vary greatly with the behavioral model used and the employer match rate on contributions.
