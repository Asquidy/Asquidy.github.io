I am an economist who studies matching markets like the labor, housing and dating markets. I focus on using novel data to build quantitative models of how people search and find matches. I then use those models to inform policy. Furthermore, I am interesting in understanding how digitization affects market structure and outcomes. Next year I will be doing an Economics of Digitization post-doc at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). I am finishing my Ph.D. in economics at Stanford and I work as a part-time data scientist at Airbnb. In my spare time I climb, write, and take long walks to discuss philosophy. You should join me.
