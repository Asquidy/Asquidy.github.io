I have long been fascinated by the question: what is the value of online search? Online search came out of the blue in the 90's and has become a ubiquitous part of life. Nonetheless, no one as far as I know has ever estimated the value of search. Advertising revenue numbers do not get at the true value of search because they do not take into account the benefit of search to searchers. Kevin Kelly has done an interesting [exercise](http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2007/10/how_much_does_o.php) in which he calculated an upper bound on the cost of a search to be 3 cents. 

Google recently released a delightful [report](http://www.google.com/insidesearch/howsearchworks/thestory/index.html) about how search works. In addition to tidbits about how Google fights spam, the report reveals the global rate of Google searches. There are approximately **40000** Google searches per second. That equates to approximately 3.5 billion searches per day and 104 billion searches a month.  According to ComScore, Google served 37 billion searches in August 2007. That means thats over the past 5 years there has been an approximately 3 fold increase in Google searches. To put this into comparison, the number of humans using the internet has doubled in that time period. Of course, many new users do not have constant access to Google or live in China. Either way, that means internet users are searching more often. According to [Internet World Stats](http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm) There are now approximate 2.4 billion internet users. I will take out approximately .4 billion for Chinese residents with no access to Google. Further, lets assume that Google has a 67% market share amongst those 2 billion that have Google access. That means that each Google user searches the internet an average of 77 times a month.
