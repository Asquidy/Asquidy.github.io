Economic agents typically search before making a decision to transact or contract with a counterparty. The process of search has taken on an important role in economics because search is costly and because search markets oftentimes create incentives for agents to act strategically, leading to inefficient outcomes. At the same time, there is a large and mostly theoretical literature on matching markets in economics. Matching markets occur when both sides of the market (buyers and sellers, students and school, men and women) have preferences over the other side of the market. Matching is typically considered in the setting of centralized markets where agents submit preferences and then an algorithm determines the match. 

The Process:
	1. Labor Search: 
		- Aggregate matching function determines flow of random matches.
		- Agents choose search intensity based on utility of matching and cost of search.
	2. Consumer search in industrial organization:
		- Agents make decision about whether to continue search or to stop.
		- Most models relate to searching for the prices of identical goods.
	3. Matching
		- Agents submit preferences.
		- Algorithm determines match.
		- Typically no prices.

The Complications:
	1. Labor Search:
		- Search externalities with limited supply of jobs.
		- Incurred search costs.
		- Is search directed?
	2. Consumer search in industrial organization:
		- Firms know that consumers search and may want to appear more attractive than they are.
			- Ellision (Search obfuscation)
		- Ranking matters.
	3. Matching
		- Agents might have an incentive to lie.
		- Effect on wages and other market outcomes?

Dimensions: 

				End. Technology, Prices, Costly Search, Two-Sided (Constraints)
Macro Labor							N	Y	Y	? 

IO 									? 	Y	Y	N

Matching    	    				Y   N   N	Y

Search and Matching Market  		Y	?	Y	Y

Markets I am thinking about:
	Labor
	Housing / Rentals
	Dating
	Used Cars
	Housing

Similar But Different Markets:
	- College Admissions (Hybrid btwn Matching Market and Search and Matching Market)
	Why? Only simultaneous search. Easier to solve but still complicated.
	- Insurance (Search market but different costs based on participants)

Assumption: Posted Prices
Future Research: How do bargaining and search interact? (Wolinsky: Matching, search, and bargaining)

Complicated: 
	- Simultaneous and Sequential Search + discrete choice (w/ Large Number of Options).
	- Endogenous consideration sets as function of technology.
	- Dynamic market clearing.
	- Assumptions about knowledge of agents regarding transaction preferences.
		- Airbnb v Dating v Large Employer v Small Employer

There is no one measure of search effort. There are actually three types of search here:

Types:
	- Consideration Set
	- Inquiry

Form:
	- Simultaneous Search
	- Sequential Search

Transactions fail not just because of preferences but because:
	- Congestion
	- Stale Vacancies

What is essential:
	- How marketplace influences search.
	- A process by which guests search.
	- A process by which hosts choose to reject.

Size of friction:
	- In abstract.
	- To the extent with which it can be reduced in practice.

Why is dynamic one friction so small:
	- If all available properties are booked, then you are just reshuffling guests. The major frictions are from unbooked rooms that could be booked.
