post_type: essay</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Introduction</em> </p>
<p>Private sector data is increasingly used in economics and other social science research. By private sector data, I mean data on product usage, transactions and other internal operations that is stored within corporate databases. The process of obtaining and working with such data poses challenges that are not present in traditionally used datasets (surveys and administrative data). In this guide I seek to discuss the important choices that researchers must make when pursuing research with the private sector. My qualification for writing this guide is my experience working with datasets from Airbnb, Google, Zonability and Womply, as well as my failures in obtaining datasets from other well known companies. I hope that this guide will be a useful resource for social scientists and others considering the best way to use "Big Data" to push the research frontier.</p>
<p>The guide is organized into the following parts:</p>

<p><em>The Pros and Cons of Using Private Sector Data</em></p>
<p>The main draw of private sector data for social scientists is the ability to observe previously unobservable data. Much of economic theory involves theoretical objects, such as search activity, consumption, communication and production costs, for which empirical analogues are hard to obtain. Social scientists have typically tried to get around their lack of data by making strong assumptions about behavior. For example, in the field of industrial organization, the costs of production are typically inferred from the production and pricing decisions of firms. Similarly, macroeconomics and labor economics typically make assumption about the process of search and matching. Private sector data provides new ways of allowing us to directly test those assumptions and to quantify the importance of theoretical mechanisms in the real world. For example, in my work with Scott Baker, we use data on Google Searches for the term 'jobs' to create a proxy for aggregate job search effort. We then use this data to study what happened to job search in response to the expansions of unemployment insurance benefits. </p>
<p>Private sector data also has other benefits for researchers. First of all, companies are often much less bureaucratic organizations than governments. Thus, it is much easier to run experiments or to exert influence on policy within a company rather than a government. Secondly, working with a company gives researchers a view inside of a company. This view is rare for career academics to have and often informs research in a positive way. For example, when I started researching Airbnb, I was mostly interested in how the platform reduces transaction costs and improves matches. However, while working at the company and talking to decision makers, I realized that experimental design is really important and challenging for marketplaces. This lesson was reflected in my thesis research, which explicitly models the differences between the true effects of experiments and the suboptimal ways in which experimental analysis is typically done. Lastly, there are specific tools (such as Hadoop, Hive and Github) that are increasingly used within companies but are not taught by academics. These tools are useful to learn because they are oftentimes more effective than the tools used by academics and because they help in obtaining high quality non-academic jobs. The last, and probably least important, benefit of working with private sector data is money. I was able to finance part of my grad school by working a part-time job with Airbnb.</p>
<p>However, working with private data is extremely risky. The biggest risk is data quality. Even if companies do record the data you are interested in, it is often the case that what is recorded is incomplete and difficult to access. Therefore, almost any plans for a project with a dataset will be greatly complicated by missing documentation and data. In mine and my classmates' experiences, it typically takes a year to learn enough of the relevant details of a company's data infrastructure to do good research. This also highlights why a relationship where the researcher does not have direct access to the data typically does not work. Researchers learn about data by manipulating it, asking further questions and iterating. If each iteration step required work from a company employee then progress would be slow and the company employees could become resentful of the researcher. The above problems might be mitigated if the data is very standardized, as in the case of auction data with bids and final sales. Another problem can occur when using data that companies publish online, such as Google Trends or Orbitz Labs data on hotel prices. This data is derived from the underlying behavioral data in a peculiar way that can be harmful to proper statistical analysis. For example, Google Trends is a public dataset that is supposed to be a proxy for the aggregate volume of searches for a particular term on Google. However, because Google oftentimes changes its product (by changing the suggested terms for a term or the algorithm), the aggregate data series may move in ways unrelated to the underlying behavior of interest. It is typically difficult to correct for these imperfections using statistical techniques. See <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6176/1203">this Science article</a> for more discussion of the pitfalls of aggregated private sector data.</p>
<p>There are other important risks when working with the private sector as a researcher:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Ambiguous Relationships:</em> The company justifiably does not want negative information to be released. Even if there is a formal agreement between the company and the researcher, there is often unspoken pressure to suppress any potentially negative information. Potential conflicts of interest highlight why, when engaged in a formal agreement with the company, it is prudent to stay out of political issues. Therefore, some avenues of research are closed off to the researcher. On the other hand, if the data is being obtained without permission, though scraping, there are different pitfalls. Specifically, the company can often detect scraping activity and fight it by banning specific ips or by serving false data to the scraper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Reproducibility:</em> Company data is often subject to a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). NDA's typically state that raw data cannot be released to the public for reproduction. Furthermore, some data, such as summary statistics, are also embargoed by company lawyers. This is a big problem for researchers using private data because reproducibility is a huge problem and is becoming an important requirement for journal submission. Even 'simple' data analysis is oftentimes non-reproducible. Reproducibility is even more important for sophisticated econometric strategies, which have a much higher chance of programming error.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Time Horizon:</em> Lastly, research takes a long time, especially in economics where the time from journal submission to publishing often exceeds 2 years even without a rejection. It is very difficult for a company to commit to such a long-term relationship if only because the employees of the company are likely to change within that span of time. Therefore, undertaking long-run research agendas with internal company data is inherently dangerous This is also a problem with scraping research strategies because the company may shut off the ability to scrape at some future time. Lastly, doing research on a company also involves making a bet on the future of a company. For example, Ned Augenblick's <a href="http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/ned/Augenblick_JMP_Penny_Auction.pdf">paper</a> about penny options would probably be more read today if the site he studies, Swoopo, did not go bankrupt.</p>

<p><em>Getting Access to Private Sector Data</em></p>
<p>Let's say that you've thought long and hard about your research project and that you've decided that you want a specific type of data. There are potentially three ways to get it: ask for it directly from a company, get it from a third-party or collect the data yourself (through scraping, surveys or field studies). To take a concrete example, suppose that you want an individual level browsing history. Here are some strategies that you might take:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ask a company like Google, Microsoft or Apple for data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask for or purchase data from a third-party like Quantcast, Nielsen or Comscore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collect your own data. For example, you could create an app that downloads individual browsing histories with the permission of the user. For other types of data you could try scraping information from websites.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>First, you should seriously consider all strategies, one of several approaches might be sufficient for your purposes, even if each approach is imperfect. Second, you should pursue as many options as possible because most of your attempts will likely fail. Furthermore, datasets from different sources are often complimentary to each other. For example, data from Airbnb is very detailed but does not include data on traditional hotel supply and demand. On the other hand, <a href="http://strglobal.com/">STR</a> collects more aggregated data on hotel supply and demand across markets and over time. These two datasets are a lot more powerful together than alone. The pros and cons of each approach to getting data are clear in the case of web browsing. Internal company data will likely be the most detailed but will also be the hardest to get and will come with the most restrictions. Third-party party data is easier to get as a researcher but is often limited and very expensive.[^2] Creating you own data is unlikely to work well for web browsing data because few users will want to give away their browsing histories. Each dataset will also suffer from varying degrees of non-representativeness. Below, I focus on approaches 1 and 2, because there are already great guides to approach 3.<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> </p>
<p>The standard way to ask for data is to look up an appropriate person within a company (using LinkedIn or Twitter) and to send an introductory email. The median outcome from a cold email is no response. Even if there is a response, it will likely not lead anywhere because there are several barriers that stand between the researcherer and the data. First of all, managers typically view providing data to researchers as a hassle and business risk. They view it as a hassle because extracting the data and navigating the company bureaucracy to release the data takes time. They view it as a business risk because there's always a chance that the researcher finds out something unpleasant about the company or is careless with the data. Furthermore, for many internet companies, there is a perception that academic research is typically hard to apply to practical company problems.<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> Each of the above objections should be addressed at some point in your conversation with the company (although not in the initial email). There are several approaches that increase the likelihood that your data request will be taken seriously:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Use Your Social Network</em>: 
    One of the best ways to get your data request taken seriously is to have a reference. Many students at Stanford, for example, have obtained data because a professor has done connections at a specific company. Alternatively, people often find that friends from college with high quality connections at companies. LinkedIn is a useful tool for finding such connections. Lastly, you can try to make your own connection with a company by going to industry events and meet-ups.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Demonstrate Value</em>: 
    One way to get attention within a company is to write a great blog post or paper on a related subject. This strategy works because it credibly signals that you are serious and capable of doing good work. Furthermore, companies are often eager to have someone write data-centric blog posts for them. This strategy worked for John Horton when Uber contacted him after this <a href="http://john-joseph-horton.com/market-clearing-without-consternation-the-case-of-ubers-surge-pricing/">post</a>. <br />
<!--- Other Examples? --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Be a Recognized Expert</em>: 
    It is much easier to convince a company to pay attention if you've published academic papers and received accolades. Of course, it is difficult to achieve this status in the short-run, but it is worth playing up any external indicators of expertise in conversations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Get an Internship</em>: 
    Perhaps the best way to start doing research with company data is to get an internship with that company first. Many companies have posted summer internships and others are willing to consider an internship even without a formal position. Doing a company internship will allow you to get to know the co-workers and to get a familiarity with the databases (something that you'll need to do anyway for doing research). If you do a good job then the company will be much more willing to let you do research with its data. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Getting data is still not trivial even after the company has agreed to talk to you. I've been in conversation with 3 different companies who ultimately said no even after initial interest and a proposal. I spent 4 months frequently communicating with one company who initially said yes but ultimately ended up saying no. The data agreement process typically starts with the company asking for a research proposal. Here are my recommendations for such a proposal. First, the proposal cannot be technical because the people reading it need to understand it. Even if you have a sophisticated model, try to explain it in the simplest words. Second of all, you should stress how the research will be useful to the company. Try to include something into your proposal that an analyst within the company should already be doing, if she had the time. If you can do something that is directly useful to the company, such as creating an infographic or index, offer to do that as well. Lastly, and most importantly, don't spend too much time on the proposal. The likelihood of failure is high and even if you get the data your research strategy will probably change. There is a much higher return to talking to multiple companies and making a mediocre proposal for each one than in talking to one company with a really good proposal. Even if you succeed, it will take several months to a year to actually go from a proposal to actually seeing the data. </p>
<p>Once you are talking to a data provider, the topic of conversation is often the exact way in which the data will be shared. There are two extreme models of data sharing. The first is that someone at the company does a one-off data pull based on a proposal from the researcher. The second is that the researcher has access to the internal databases of a company. </p>
